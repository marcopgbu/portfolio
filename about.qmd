# About Me

Hi! I’m **Marco Perez**, a data science enthusiast with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University, where I’ve developed strong skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning. I enjoy working on real-world projects that solve meaningful problems — whether it’s predicting housing prices, visualizing market trends, or building custom analytics dashboards.

What drives me is the blend of technical depth and creativity that data science offers. I believe that great analytics isn't just about algorithms — it’s about telling the right story.
